# A WORDLE FLUTTER 

A Wordle clone in Turkish for Flutter Web & Mobile

## A few words...

This app can be run on both mobile platforms and Web platform.

Web app can listen to the Turkish keyboard events.

I tried to explore and implement BLoC library for state management, and used two Cubits for puzzle table & keyboard separately.
Built-in keyboard is forked from pub.dev and converted to Turkish Q Type.

## Potential improvements
- Localization settings for EN, DE, etc. .
- Dark Theme
- Decoupling the Turkish keyboard as a separate package and publish it on pub.dev
